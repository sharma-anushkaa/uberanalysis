analysis on the uber data set


This notebook uses the data-set to analyse when maximum uber rides are booked, and when can maximum profit be generated.

 These are the key insights obtained:

; how long do people travel with uber? 
    > most people were found to travel between 0-30 miles, indicating very less people used uber for cross city trips. our target customers then narrow down to people that use uber to commute daily to and from work 
    
; what hour do most people take uber?
    > one would think that maximum rides would be booked either in the morning at 9 am when the work place opens, or at around 5 when work gets over. surprisingly, on analysing the data, i found out that 1 pm and 2 pm is when most people book their rides. It is best to send targeted ads and deals to customers during this duration. 
    
; what purpose do most customers use uber for?
    > most customers were found to book rides for meetings, and next up were for entertainment and meals. we can provide discounts and coupons for people falling into the second category(for example: a discount on booking of the film if they take an uber there etc)
    
 ; which day has the max number of trips?
    > most trips are found to be taken on friday. again, while tuesday through sunday have almost the same number of trips. most of ubers profit is generated then, and we can send push notifications etc on fridays to attract more users.
    
; which month had maximum rides?
    > most rides were seen to be taken in december, february, june, and march. i notice slightly lesser commute in january, november, april, may and july, but still better than october and september. uber derives most of its profit from december.
    
 ; where did most uber rides begin?
    > while a large number of locations were unknown, perhaps because they end up using it's "my current location" option instead of manually selecting it, i did notice that Cary was an area where uber was highly being used. we can use this information to perhaps have more rides situated around the area.
